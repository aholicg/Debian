# 1. Make Ctrl+C = Copy
# This overrides the default "interrupt" behavior
{ key = "C", mods = "Control", action = "Copy" }

# 2. Make Ctrl+V = Paste
# This is the logical counterpart to the copy binding
{ key = "V", mods = "Control", action = "Paste" }

# 3. Make Ctrl+Shift+C = Interrupt (SIGINT)
# This overrides the default "copy" behavior for this combo
# We send the \u0003 control character, which is SIGINT
{ key = "C", mods = "Control|Shift", action = "SendChars", chars = "\u0003" }

# 4. (Optional) Unbind Ctrl+Shift+V from Paste
# This completes the swap, so only Ctrl+V is paste.
{ key = "V", mods = "Control|Shift", action = "None" }
